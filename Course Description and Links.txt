

Description:
In this short course you will create a real Chat GPT-4o-mini trading algo in MT5.
GPT-4o-mini will analyse financial news articles, key financial statements and 
MT5 chart screenshots that are received via HTTP REQUEST. It will ping-back a HTTP RESPONSE;
a 250 word summary and a one word summary "Bullish", "Bearish", "Flat", "Close-All".
That RESPONSE will be stored in a SQL based DB. MT5 will take buy/Sell signals from that DB.
You'll be using the OpenAI API, #Python, #SQL, #PHP and #MQL5 .
